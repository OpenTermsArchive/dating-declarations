# Declarations of terms tracked in the *Dating* collection

The terms in this collection are declared and maintained since January 2023 by [mvidonne](https://github.com/mvidonne) for the [Dating Privacy collective](https://dating-privacy.hestialabs.org/) with the support of [HestiaLabs](https://hestialabs.org) until end of 2022 and tracked using [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org).

You can [explore the tracked versions](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/dating-versions) interactively or [download them as a dataset](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/dating-versions/releases) in the `OpenTermsArchive/dating-versions` repository.

## Suggested engine updates

In order to keep the Open Terms Archive engine up-to-date, updates will be automatically suggested by [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) in a pull request when a new version is available.

While engine updates follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) standard and automated collection tests should provide a safety net, it is ultimately the responsibility of the maintainers of the collection to check version compatibility and potentially adjust the declarations before applying these updates.
